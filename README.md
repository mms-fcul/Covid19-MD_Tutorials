# In silico end-to-end protein-ligand interaction characterization pipeline: the case of SARS-CoV-2

In the last decadas, the world has seen at least three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) in 2002, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in 2019. At the time of publication, several countries find themselves in a pandemic state with severe clinical, social and economical consequences, both short and long term, leading to over 600 thousand deaths and more than 14.5 million confirmed cases (as of July 21,2020). No effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are available in the market that specifically target SARS-CoV-2, despite a global effort. To that end, there is an imperative need to develop effective protocols to help understand and characterize not only SARS-CoV-2, but possible future diseases, using in silico approaches.
